This is preliminary repository for databank of IDP simulations developed in the FAIRMD project.

This works in the same way a the [NMRlipids databank](https://github.com/NMRLipids/Databank)

AddData creates README files where proteins are defined using FASTA sequence

CalcProperties currently calculates contact, distance and backbone correlation maps, radius of gyration distributions, dynamic landscapes and spin relaxation times.
